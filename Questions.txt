One glaring problem to me right now however, is that this isnt monetizable. A subscription to a person who watches all 168 hours a week is the same as those that watch 
1 hour a week. This increased consumption isnt profitable right now, nor is the size of the current male subscriber population.

One potential solution is changing the subsciption plan to be a subscription and package model or a freemium model. Allowing subscribers to access more general content at a base/discounted/fre rate
